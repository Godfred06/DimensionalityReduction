# DimensionalityReduction
For unsupervised learning, determining the clusters (ideal number) can act as a primer and to determine the different classes that are present in the data for subsequent supervised learning. Visualizing high dimensional data in a low dimensional space can be used to determine the number of clusters in the data. This Repo contains various methods in Python and Machine Learning for dimensionality reduction and clustering of the data.
